Feature: Production Management
 As a country production manager
 In order to ensure our production processes run smoothly with our order and shipping processes 
 I want to be able to effectivley manage our production

Scenario: The system helps me work out which item to produce next

Scenario: I can easily select which rugs I will produce next

Scenario: I can bulk upload pictures of rugs recently produced.

Scenario: I can record who made each rug

Scenario: I can easily record key details of each rug produced (who made it, when was it made, description (colors etc), product type)

Scenario: I know details of rugs currently in production

Scenario: I can tell which rugs are ready for shipment

Scenario: I can easily bulk mark rugs as being included in a specific shipment
